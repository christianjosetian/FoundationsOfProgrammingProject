old_motorplayer.py was turned in for full score.  It scored 4th highest in class of 300.  
Subsequently I improved the solution in new_motorplayer.py and then tested against a Travelling Sales Person (TSP) solution.  
No significant improvements were found to date but TSP on an aggregated grid is the likely area of advancement.
